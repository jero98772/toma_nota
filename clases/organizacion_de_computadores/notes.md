1. **Inputs and Outputs**:
    - `inM[16]`: 16-bit input representing the value from RAM at a specific address.
    - `instruction[16]`: 16-bit instruction for execution.
    - `reset`: Signal indicating whether to restart the current program or continue executing.
    - `outM[16]`: 16-bit output representing the value to write to RAM.
    - `writeM`: Signal indicating whether to write to RAM.
    - `addressM[15]`: 15-bit address in data memory.
    - `pc[15]`: 15-bit address of the next instruction.

2. **Parts**:
    - **Instruction decoding**:
        - `Or` gate to check if it's a C instruction.
        - `Not` gate to check if it's an A instruction.
    - **Register Loading**:
        - `And` gate to determine if the destination is A.
        - `Mux16` to choose between the instruction and output of the ALU based on the destination.
        - Loading into the A Register (`ARegister`).
    - **D Register**:
        - `And` gate to determine if the destination is D.
        - Loading into the D Register (`DRegister`).
    - **ALU**:
        - Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) performing various operations based on control bits from the instruction.
    - **Flag Setting and Program Counter**:
        - Setting output flags based on ALU output.
        - Determining whether to write to RAM.
        - Determining jump conditions (JGT, JEQ, JLT).
        - Updating the program counter based on jump conditions and the instruction.

3. **Overall Functionality**:
    - The CPU takes inputs (`inM`, `instruction`, `reset`) and provides outputs (`outM`, `writeM`, `addressM`, `pc`) based on the instruction and control signals.
    - It decodes instructions, loads data into registers, performs ALU operations, sets flags, and updates the program counter accordingly.
