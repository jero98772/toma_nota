# [Hacker Manifest by "The Mentor"](<http://www.phrack.org/issues/7/3.html>) my thing about this

■reasons to be a hacker and do hacker "things" make you a hacker

■thinking about why and changing the way things are done

■if you don't like what you learn, it's not worth learning

■you miss the point of spending years on something if you don't enjoy the years

■people repeat and repeat several times, don't they listen?

■I know that at least I am not the only one who did this: "The task? I did it in my head" like this Manifest

■ "If it makes a mistake, it's because I screwed it up.

Not because it doesn't like me...

Or feels threatened by me...

Or thinks I'm a smart ass...

Or doesn't like teaching and shouldn't be here...

Damn kid. All he does is play games."

a way to understand errors

■ And then it happened... a door opened to a world... "This is it... this is where I belong..."

■ I know everyone here... even if I've never met them, never talked to them

■ I consider myself a hacker but I don't know if I'm fit to be

■ This is our world now... the world of the electron and the switch, the beauty of the baud.

■"... and you call us criminals. We exist without skin color,

without nationality, without religious bias... and you call us criminals.

You build atomic bombs, you wage wars, you murder, cheat, and lie to us

and try to make us believe it's for our own good, yet we're the criminals."

I am a hacker, and this is my manifesto.

You may stop this individual,

but you can't stop us all... after all, we're all alike.

I don't like the part that talks like a superior but sometimes takes advantage of it to help others and me

**this is my hacker own manifesto and critique of the manifesto**
