* algebra
** algebra always use arimethic but it is not arimethic
** algebra is coneciction between mathematics branchs
* operators
** operation is a function which takes zero or more input values
*** can operate a single number or a two numbers not more not less
**** operators who operate 1 number is called unary operators ,not, trigonometric fuctions, |x| etc..
**** operators who operate 2 numbers is called  binary operatos like a + - and  or * / ** , sqrt,etc..
*** opearete not only numbers also vectors, intersections, unions, functions
* equation
** 
* Equality 
** is the realition  beteewn two quantities or, more generally two mathematical expressions
*** math expresions  is a finite combination of symbols if it were not finite it would be something else
** write with expresion1 = expresion2
** in equality it can be a comparison of two values is an equality (true) or there is no equality (false)
* elementary algebra
** there is something more incomprehensible than those who handle numbers(reals , comlpex)
