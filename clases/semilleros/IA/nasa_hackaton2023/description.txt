**What exactly does it do?**
The Open Science Project Marketplace is an online platform dedicated to the promotion and facilitation of open science. It serves as a centralized hub where researchers, scientists, and open science enthusiasts can interact, discover, and collaborate on open science projects. The platform allows users to showcase their projects, receive endorsements for their skills, provide and receive feedback and reviews, participate in community forums, and benefit from personalized AI-powered recommendations for project discovery.


**We see this problematic**

A prevalent challenge faced by individuals engaged in citizen science initiatives is the lack of connectivity and visualizations within their community. While citizen science has gained momentum as a powerful tool for crowdsourcing valuable scientific data, participants often find themselves isolated in their efforts, lacking a sense of collective engagement. This disconnect not only limits opportunities for knowledge sharing and collaboration but also hinders the potential for collective impact. Furthermore, the absence of effective visualizations and data representation tools can make it difficult for citizen scientists to comprehend and communicate their findings, diminishing the overall effectiveness of their contributions. Addressing these issues by fostering a sense of community and providing intuitive visualization tools is crucial in harnessing the full potential of citizen science and ensuring that the valuable data collected can drive meaningful scientific insights and policy decisions.

**How does it work?**
1. **Project Discovery:** Users can explore a diverse range of open science projects through the Project Discovery Feed.
2. **Skill Endorsements:** Community members can endorse the skills of project contributors, establishing trust and recognition.
3. **Project Showcase:** Project creators can exhibit their work, making it accessible to a wider audience.
4. **Feedback and Review System:** Users can offer insights, critiques, and feedback on projects, promoting improvement and accountability.
5. **Community Forums:** Virtual spaces for discussions, knowledge sharing, and problem-solving among participants.
6. **Integration with ORCID:** Simplifies user authentication and ensures accurate attribution of contributions.
7. **In-Platform Messaging with AI:** Offers personalized project recommendations and feedback to enhance user engagement.

**What do you hope to achieve?**
The primary goal of the Open Science Project Marketplace is to advance the principles of open science by creating a vibrant and collaborative ecosystem. We aim to foster innovation, transparency, and knowledge sharing within the global scientific community. Our vision is to become the go-to platform for open science enthusiasts, facilitating the growth of open science projects and the exchange of ideas.

**Tools, Coding Languages, Hardware, or Software Used:**
- **Technology Stack:** We utilized a robust technology stack, including but not limited to Python, FastAPI, JavaScript, React and MongoDB for the backend and frontend development.

- **AI and Machine Learning:** AI and machine learning libraries and frameworks like langchain, pandas and open Api were employed to power the in-platform messaging and recommendation system.

- **Cloud Services:** We hosted our marketplace  in Digitalocean  on cloud infrastructure for scalability and reliability.

- **User Interface (UI) Design Tools:** Tools like [bing](http://bing.com/create) Figma for UI/UX design, resulting in an intuitive and visually appealing interface.

- **Database Management:** MongoDB was used to manage and store project data securely.

 the Open Science Project Marketplace is a comprehensive platform designed to elevate open science, foster collaboration, and provide valuable tools and resources to the open science community. It aspires to catalyze innovation and contribute to the global advancement of knowledge. 



Did you utilize any Artificial Intelligence tools and software in preparing your solution? If yes, which ones and how did you use them? (The answer to this question will not impact the judging of your project.)

Yes, in the development of our solution, we incorporated Artificial Intelligence tools and software to enhance user usability and provide valuable feedback and information. We implemented a chat system using a combination of "Langchain" and the OpenAI's API. This AI-powered chatbot serves as an interactive interface for users, allowing them to ask questions about projects, receive feedback, and engage in discussions related to open science. Additionally, the chatbot assists in filtering and organizing project-related information on the webpage, ensuring that users can easily access relevant content and make informed decisions. This integration of AI technology not only improves the user experience but also contributes to the overall functionality and effectiveness of our platform in fostering collaboration and knowledge sharing within the open science community.
