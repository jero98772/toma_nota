This quantity has to be used as a filter to remove observations of low quality and observations which are not of interest for a certain application. The *qa_value* has a value between 0 and 1:\n","- *qa_value* = 0: There was an error during the retrieval and this value can never be used in a meaningful way.\n","- *qa_value* = 1: There are no warnings or errors, and this pixel can always be used.\n","- 0 < *qa_value* < 1: One or more warnings or cautions popped up in the retrieval\n","\n","The retrieval groups also provide *qa_value* thresholds (normally 0.5) with the recommendation to use only retrievals with values bigger than this number. For the NO$_2$ product we have two thresholds:\n","\n","- *qa_value* > 0.75. \n","    This is the recommended pixel filter. It removes cloud-covered scenes (cloud radiance fraction > 0.5), partially snow/ice covered scenes, errors, and problematic retrievals.\n","- *qa_value* > 0.50.\n","    Compared to the stricter filter, this adds the good quality retrievals over clouds and over scenes covered by snow/ice. Errors and problematic retrievals are still filtered out. In particular, this filter may be useful for assimilation and model comparison studies.\n","\n","\n","The *qa_value* should not be mistaken with the estimated error of the product. This is a separate field. For example, the main product in the NO$_2$ file is **nitrogendioxide_tropospheric_column** \n","with an estimated error\n","**nitrogendioxide_tropospheric_column_precision**.\n","\n","In the retrieval this uncertainty is estimated, taking into account several aspects like the instrument noise of TROPOMI, uncertainties in the characterisation of the clouds, aerosols, surface reflectivity (albedo) and errors in the estimation of the stratospheric NO$_2$ column. \n","___\n","\n","We start the tutorial by loading the required Python packages. In this case we only need \"numpy\" (for mathematical calculations with arrays) and \"netCDF4\" which is the package to read the TROPOMI data.
