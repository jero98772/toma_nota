    "\n",
    "Nitrogen dioxide is an important trace gas in the stratosphere because of its role in the photochemistry of ozone. NO + NO$_2$ (NO$_x$) in the stratosphere originates from the oxidation of N$_2$O in the middle stratosphere. NO + NO$_2$ destroy ozone catalytically, but they can also suppress ozone depletion by converting reactive chlorine and hydrogen compounds into unreactive reservoirs such as ClONO$_2$ and HNO$_3$. Monitoring of stratospheric NO$_2$ thus provides important support to monitoring of the ozone layer. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the stratosphere, NO$_2$ is in equilibrium with its reservoirs N$_2$O$_5$ and HNO$_3$. Both are being photolyzed during the day, and reform during the night. As a result, the amount of NO$_2$ in the stratosphere depends on the number of hours of sunshine. This leads to variations during the day, and a strong seasonality with maximum NO$_2$ in Summer and minimum NO$_2$ in winter at mid and high latitudes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the long residence times of nitrogen oxides in the stratosphere, and because the amount of illumination depends on season and latitude, the stratospheric NO$_2$ column is mainly a function of latitude, and not longitude.

    "- When the scene is covered by clouds, hiding the NO$_2$ below from view. \n",
    "- When the surface is very dark, e.g. for forests\n",

    "\n",
    "All these aspects, surface brightness (albedo), cloud cover, and the vertical density profile shape of NO$_2$, are leading to substantial unertainties in the retrieved NO$_2$ tropospheric column amount. These uncertainties can range between 20-60% over polluted regions.\n",

    "\n",
    "The radiation intensity in the atmosphere is height-dependent and this implies that also the increase of the measured absorption (the NO$_2$ slant column) to an increase in NO$_2$ at some altitude will be height dependent. This dependence is described by the averaging kernel.\n",

Figure is taken from Eskes and Boersma 2003, https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-3-1285-2003.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The figure shows three examples of kernels. When the surface is very dark (a), for instance above a forest, the sensitivity drops to low values near the surface. When the surface is bright (b), for instance above a sandy desert or when there is snow, the drop is much smaller and the sensitivity is much more uniform. TROPOMI can not look through thick clouds (c), and this is demonstrated by the drop of the sensitivity to zero below the cloud, which is located at 800 hPa in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "This variation in sensitivity also means that the tropospheric NO$_2$ column depends on the assumed vertical distribution (profile shape) of NO$_2$ in the troposphere. In the TROPOMI retrievals these profiles are generated with a global-scale chemistry-transport model (CTM). This model runs on gridcells of 1 by 1 degree (about 100 by 100 km) and is relatively coarse. Such a model is therefore not very realistic in describing the variability of the profile around a hotspot, such as a city or a power plant. Therefore it may be good to replace the default profiles by profiles generated by a regional CTM or air quality model run at higher resolution (e.g. 10 by 10 km or 2 by 2 km). The Product User Manual describes how such a NO$_2$ profile replacement can be implemented, by exploiting the averaging kernel information.\n",
    "\n",
    "One main application of the TROPOMI data is the testing of CTMs by comparing the modelled NO$_2$ with the TROPOMI retrieval. Such comparisons should make use of the averaging kernel vector **A** through the following equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "V_m = **A x**$_m$\n",
    "\n",
    "where **x**$_m$ is the model profile at the location of the TROPOMI observation, expressed as a column amount in each vertical model layer, with same units as TROPOMI, e.g. mol/m$^2$. The vector product **A x** is then compared with the TROPOMI tropospheric column.\n",
    "\n",
    "A nice and very important property of the comparison done in this way: the relative difference, e.g. (model - tropomi) / tropomi, is no longer dependent on the global CTM profiles used for the retrieval.\n",
